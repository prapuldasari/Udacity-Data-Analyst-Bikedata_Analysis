**US-Bikeshare-Analysis-Udacity-Project:**<br />
This project uses Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States. Data wrangling is done to unify the format of data from the three systems and write code to compute descriptive statistics. It also encompases the use of a package that is not part of the standard Python library to help visualize the data.
Also the analysis was carried out in an interactive way where user can select various filters to condense the data to apply the analysis on.<br />

**Analysis Followed:**<br />
1.Inspect the structure of the original data (very important)<br />
2.Clean the data<br />
3.Answer questions about the data using descriptive statistics<br />
4.Visualize the data (instead of using plt use seaborn or ggplot)<br />
5.Perform additional exploratory analysis<br />
6.Consider where data analysis can be applied to other fields<br />

**Steps Followed:**<br />
1.Download relevant information (Done)<br />
2.Familiarize myself with the data (Done)<br />
3.Pose some questions that can be answered by simple analysis (Done)<br />
4.Consider what information I will need to do said analysis (Done)<br />
5.Carry out analysis (Done)<br />
6.Convert ipynb to PDF - nbconvert package<br />
