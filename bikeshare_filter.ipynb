    "Bay Area Bike Share is a company that provides on-demand bike rentals for customers in San Francisco, Redwood City, Palo Alto, Mountain View, and San Jose. Users can unlock bikes from a variety of stations throughout each city, and return them to any station within the same city. Users pay for the service either through a yearly subscription or by purchasing 3-day or 24-hour passes. Users can make an unlimited number of trips, with trips under thirty minutes in length having no additional charge; longer trips will incur overtime fees.\n",

    "In this project, I will put myself in the shoes of a data analyst performing an exploratory analysis on the data. Here I will take a look at two of the major parts of the data analysis process: data wrangling and exploratory data analysis. Here I will be working on finding out few insights from the data which will help in **making smarter business decisions? Or you might think about if you were a user of the bike share service. What factors might influence how you would want to use the service?**"
